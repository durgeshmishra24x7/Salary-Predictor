# Salary-Predictor
Objective: - This tool is basically built to help our HR people to determine the salary of the Employee based on their job band, Employee Experience, Employee test score, Employee interview scores.   The simple Linear regression technique is used to build this Machine Learning project. We used the dataset from Kaggle., which contains Employee experience, Test_score(Out of 10), Interview_Score(out of 10), Salary(Rs). In the dataset Employee Experience is mentioned in the text that has been handled by converting it into the number.   Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm where the predicted output is continuous and has a constant slope. Itâ€™s used to predict values within a continuous range, (e.g. sales, price) rather than trying to classify them into categories (e.g. cat, dog). There are two main types:   1. Simple regression,  ---> y=mx+b 2. Multivariable regression --> f(x,y,z)=w1x+w2y+w3z  To design GUI python Pyqt5 package is used for beautiful dynamic GUI. Some video effects are also added to gain the audience attention on the presentation.
